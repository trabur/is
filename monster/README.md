What are the different levels of information clearances?

"There are several levels of information clearance in the United States, including:

1) Confidential: information that, if disclosed, could cause damage to national security.
2) Secret: information that, if disclosed, could cause serious damage to national security.
3) Top Secret: information that, if disclosed, could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security.
4) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI): a type of Top Secret clearance that grants access to specific, compartmentalized information.
5) Special Access Programs (SAPs): a type of clearance that grants access to highly sensitive information and is granted on a "need-to-know" basis." - ChatGPT

Javelin NLAW sounds like the kind of thing you don't want in your repository code reviewing the "top-end" of your full-stack; what are your thoughts on E2E black box testing?
"The Javelin NLAW (No Longer in Association With) is a portable, one-shot, anti-tank guided missile produced by Thales Group. It is not something that would typically be found in code repository or used in code review.

As for black box testing, it is a type of testing that focuses on the input and output of a system or component, without considering the internal implementation. Black box testing can be useful for ensuring that a system or component behaves as expected, based on its specifications and requirements. It can also help identify any discrepancies or defects in the system or component. However, it is often used in combination with other types of testing, such as white box testing, which looks at the internal implementation of the system or component, in order to provide a more complete testing approach." - ChatGPT

during music class everything is either a note or an instrument. just how do instruments produce notes anyways? perhaps it is the passing of air over some surface. simple enough. perhaps it is the passing of light over some surface. too complex. whatever the case may be giant structures like the Great Pyramid Of Giza are among the list of things that make me wonder.

What is a general classification rider?
"A general classification rider, also known as a GC rider, is a cyclist who is competing for the overall win in a multi-stage cycling race, such as the Tour de France. The GC rider is typically considered to be the strongest rider in the race and is often the leader of their team. They are typically good at all aspects of cycling, including climbing, time trialing, and sprinting. The leader in overall classification is often determined by time and the rider with the lowest total time at the end of the race is declared the winner." - ChatGPT
